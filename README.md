# 👋 Hi, I'm Wasif Ul Islam Shah

## 🧠 Senior Software Engineer, Technical Lead & Software Architect

I’m a hands-on **Technical Lead** and **Senior Software Engineer** with deep expertise in **Rust**, **Substrate**, **Solana**, and **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**. I specialize in building **secure**, **scalable**, and **high-performance backend systems** that power decentralized applications, **zk-integrated infrastructure**, and **real-time microservices**.

My engineering is grounded in **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, enabling me to architect modular, maintainable systems that adapt to complex product needs. I’ve delivered full-stack backend systems—from API design and microservices to blockchain integration and AI-powered workflows.

## 🔬 Recent Technical Focus

Most recently, I’ve led the development of **zk-compression-based shielded transfers** using **Light Protocol** on **Solana**, enabling **privacy-first token transfers** backed by **zk-SNARKs** and **compressed Merkle commitments**. This work blends zero-knowledge cryptography with real-world financial logic in high-performance environments.

Additionally, I’ve expanded into **AI-aligned project delivery**, with certifications in:
- 🧠 Prompt Engineering  
- 🧱 GenAI Data Infrastructure  
- 📊 CPMAI™ (Cognitive Project Management for AI)

These complement my backend and blockchain work, enabling me to lead initiatives at the intersection of **AI**, **Web3**, and enterprise systems.

## 🧱 Architectural Philosophy

I design systems that are:
- 🧩 **Modular** — separated by domain and responsibility  
- 🔁 **Resilient** — designed for failure recovery and uptime  
- 🚀 **Horizontally Scalable** — optimized for scale through architecture

Whether it’s zk-integrated backends, AI-enhanced pipelines, or low-latency Web3 services, I focus on systems that are robust, future-ready, and grounded in clean code.
