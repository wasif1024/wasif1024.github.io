# 👋 Hi, I'm Wasif Ul Islam Shah

## 🧠 Protocol Engineer & Senior Software Engineer

I'm a **Protocol Engineer and Senior Software Engineer** with **4+ years of Rust** and **10+ years of backend experience**, specializing in **privacy-preserving and real-time systems**.

I design high-performance blockchain infrastructure across **Solana and Substrate**, with hands-on expertise in protocol-level DeFi systems including **collateralized stablecoins (CDPs)**, **oracle-driven pricing**, **liquidation mechanisms**, **confidential execution**, **zero-knowledge systems**, and **cross-chain interoperability**.

My recent work focuses on **Decentralized Confidential Computing using Arcium MPC**, including encrypted input handling, confidential execution flows, and verifiable on-chain settlement for Solana programs.

I complement my technical work with strong finance fundamentals, having completed the **CFA Institute Investment Foundations® Certificate**, covering market structure, risk, portfolio construction, and ethics—knowledge that directly informs protocol incentive design and execution models.

Previously, I worked on large-scale real-time messaging systems at Botim, building low-latency, fault-tolerant backend services in Rust and gRPC.
