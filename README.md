# 👋 Hi, I'm Wasif Ul Islam Shah

## 🧠 Protocol Engineer, Technical Lead & Blockchain Architect

I’m a **Protocol Engineer & Technical Lead** with deep expertise in **Rust, Substrate, Solana, and Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**. I specialize in building **secure, scalable, and high-performance blockchain systems** that power decentralized protocols, **privacy-first infrastructure**, and **real-time services**.  

My engineering approach is grounded in **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, enabling me to architect modular, maintainable systems for complex environments. I’ve delivered end-to-end blockchain platforms — from **runtime and pallet development** to **ZK-enabled cryptography, interoperability frameworks, and backend infrastructure**.

## 🔬 Recent Technical Focus  

- Built a **zk-compression–based shielded transfer system** on **Solana**, using **Light Protocol** for privacy-first token transfers with stealth addresses and zk-SNARK verification.  
- Currently leading development of **FintraDex**, a next-generation **orderbook DEX** on Substrate. Under active development, it integrates **Risc0 zkVM** for **trustless off-chain order matching** and **ISMP + Hyperbridge** for **seamless cross-chain trading** across Substrate, Solana, and EVM ecosystems.  
- Leveraging my expertise in **ZK systems and interoperability** to deliver **scalable, privacy-preserving, and cross-chain DeFi infrastructure**.  
- Expanding into **AI-integrated delivery** with certifications in Prompt Engineering, GenAI Data Infrastructure, and CPMAI™.

## 🧱 Architectural Philosophy  

I design systems that are:  
- **Modular** — separated by domain and responsibility  
- **Resilient** — designed for recovery and long-term uptime  
- **Horizontally Scalable** — optimized for throughput and growth  

From **ZK-integrated backends** to **cross-chain orderbook protocols**, I focus on systems that are **robust, interoperable, and future-ready**.
