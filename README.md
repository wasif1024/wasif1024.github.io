# üëã Hi, I'm Wasif Ul Islam Shah

## üß† Senior Software Engineer, Technical Lead & Software Architect

I'm a hands-on **Technical Lead** and **Senior Software Engineer** with deep expertise in **Rust**, **Substrate**, **Solana**, and **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)**. I specialize in building **secure**, **scalable**, and **high-performance backend systems** that power decentralized applications, **zk-integrated infrastructure**, and **real-time microservices**.

My engineering is grounded in **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, enabling me to architect modular, maintainable systems that adapt to complex product needs. I've delivered full-stack backend systems‚Äîfrom API design and microservices to blockchain integration and AI-powered workflows.

## üî¨ Recent Technical Focus

Most recently, I've led the development of **zk-compression-based shielded transfers** using **Light Protocol** on **Solana**, enabling **privacy-first token transfers** backed by **zk-SNARKs** and **compressed Merkle commitments**. This work blends zero-knowledge cryptography with real-world financial logic in high-performance environments.

Additionally, I've expanded into **AI-aligned project delivery**, with certifications in:
- üß† Prompt Engineering  
- üß± GenAI Data Infrastructure  
- üìä CPMAI‚Ñ¢ (Cognitive Project Management for AI)

These complement my backend and blockchain work, enabling me to lead initiatives at the intersection of **AI**, **Web3**, and enterprise systems.

## üß± Architectural Philosophy

I design systems that are:
- üß© **Modular** ‚Äî separated by domain and responsibility  
- üîÅ **Resilient** ‚Äî designed for failure recovery and uptime  
- üöÄ **Horizontally Scalable** ‚Äî optimized for scale through architecture

Whether it's zk-integrated backends, AI-enhanced pipelines, or low-latency Web3 services, I focus on systems that are robust, future-ready, and grounded in clean code.
