# 👋 Hi, I'm Wasif Ul Islam Shah

# 🧠 Senior Software Engineer & Software Architect

Hi, I'm a Senior Software Engineer and Software Architect with deep expertise in building **scalable**, **high-performance backend systems** and **decentralized applications**. I specialize in **Rust** and **Node.js**, with advanced experience in **zero-knowledge cryptography**—including **zk-compression**, **zk-Rollups**, and **RISC Zero’s zkVM** for provable computation. I also leverage **Celestia** as a modular data availability layer to design scalable Layer 1 blockchain infrastructures.

## 🧱 Architectural Philosophy

Grounded in **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**, I build systems that are:
- **Modular**
- **Resilient**
- **Horizontally Scalable**

Whether it's Web2 microservices or cryptographically secure Web3 protocols, my focus is on future-proof, maintainable infrastructure.
